# TicTacToeSwift
Very simple TicTacToe to get to learn Swift...... Enjoy !!!

Use the code for your own game ...... just enjoy programming Swift! 

If you use the code ... separate the game logic from the viewcontroller ... I made it only this way so you have a totalview of the code which perhaps beginners better understand. I will make a better version with a cleaner viewcontroller later on and add it as a separate project in Github !
